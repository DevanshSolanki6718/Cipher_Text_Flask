# Cipher_Text_Flask
🧪 Built a Hacker-Themed Cipher Tool Using Flask 🔐

I recently created a small web project using Python Flask that lets users encrypt or decrypt secret messages using the classic Caesar (Shift) Cipher. Styled like a terminal interface, it simulates the feel of a hacker console — just for fun and learning. 💻💚

💡 How it works:
The app takes in a message and a numeric key, then:

For encryption, it shifts each character forward in the alphabet by the key.

For decryption, it shifts them backward to recover the original.

It also smartly handles non-alphabetic characters like symbols and digits.

🛠️ The backend is built in Flask, with the frontend styled using CSS and subtle animations. I designed most parts myself — but yes, I did refer to some internet resources for styling ideas I wasn’t familiar with (especially for animations and terminal effects). Instead of blindly copying, I learned and adapted them to fit the project’s theme.

This was a great hands-on project that combined basic cryptography with frontend-user experience and Python backend handling.
